         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>A Consistent Anti to her Son“Look at the hazards, the risks, the physical dangers that ladies would be exposed
         to at the polls.”—Anti-suffrage speech.You’re twenty-one to-day, Willie,And a danger lurks at the door,I’ve known about it always,But I never spoke before;When you were only a babyIt seemed so very remote,But you’re twenty-one to-day, Willie,And old enough to vote.You must not go to the polls, Willie,Never go to the polls,They’re dark and dreadful placesWhere many lose their souls;They smirch, degrade and coarsen,Terrible things they doTo quiet, elderly women—What would they do to you!If you’ve a boyish fancyFor any measure or man,Tell me, and I’ll tell Father,He’ll vote for it, if he can.He casts my vote, and Louisa’s,And Sarah, and dear Aunt Clo;Wouldn’t you let him vote for you?Father, who loves you so?I’ve guarded you always, Willie,Body and soul from harm;I’ll guard your faith and honor,Your innocence and charmFrom the polls and their evil spirits,Politics, rum and pelf;Do you think I’d send my only sonWhere I would not go myself?

Of note is the addition of an exclamation
         mark at the end of line 4, stanza 2 ,which alters intonation as well as formal structure.What would be left for us to do—Except to cease to be?
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>Lines to Mr. Bowdle of OhioThe women of this smart capital are beautiful. Their beauty is disturbing to business;
         their feet are beautiful, their ankles are beautiful, but here I must pause.”—Press report ofMr. Bowdle’s anti-suffrage speech in Congress, January 12, 1915.Difference between "fine allusion to" and "favourite one about" the hen is significant.
         Below the poem, additional context about Bowdle can be found under the header "How
         Women are Represented in Mr. Bowdle's Family", specifically the way his anti-suffrage
         political activity contrasts with the beliefs of his wife and sister, who are pro
         suffrage. Two quotes from Bowdle's speeches that objectify women are included in the
         "Pearls" section.You, who despise the so-called fairer sex,Be brave. There really isn’t any reasonYou should not, if you wish, oppose and vexAnd scold us in, andevenoftenout,of season;But don’t regard it as your bounden dutyTo open with a tribute to our beauty.Say,if you like,that women have no sense,No self-control, no power of concentration;,Say that hysterics is our one defenceOur virtue but an absence of temptation;These I can bear, but,oh, I own it ranklesTo hear you maundering on about our ankles.Tell those old stories, which have now and thenBeen from the Record thoughtfully deleted,;Repeat thatfavorite one aboutfine allusion tothe hen,Repeat the ones that cannot be repeated;But in the midst of such enjoyments, smotherThe impulse to extol your “sainted mother.”
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>On Not Believing All You HearWomen are angels, they are jewels, they are queens and princesses of our hearts—Anti-suffrage speech ofMr. Carterof Oklahoma.“Angel, or jewel, or princess, or queen,Tell me immediately,whereyouhaveyoubeen?.”This poem was first published without the title. Notably, the first line group was
         originally framed as an imperative demand and then changed to an interrogative request
         for the wherabouts of the woman.“I’ve been to ask all my slaves so devotedWhy they against my enfranchisement voted.”“Angel and princess, that action was wrong.Back to the kitchen, where angels belong.”
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>The Revolt of MotherEvery true woman feels---—Speech of almost any Congressman.I am old-fashioned, and I think it rightThat man should know, by Nature’s laws eternal,The proper way to rule, to earn, to fight,And exercise those functions called paternal;But even I a little bit rebelAt finding that he knows my job as well.At least he’s always ready to expound it,Especially in legislative hall,The joys, the cares, the halos that surround it,“Howwomengood wivesfeel”—he knows that best of all.The alteration of the quotation in line 4 group 2 (from "good wives" to "women") marks
         a noteworthy break between versions of this poem, with the book generalizing and somewhat
         neutralizing the value judgements detected in the ephemeral version. See Carole Rumens'
         analysis of "The Revolt of Mother" in the Guardian for another perspective.In fact his thesis is that no one canKnow what is womanly except a man.I am old-fashioned, and I am contentWhen he explains the world of art and scienceAnd government—to him divinely sent—I drink it in with ladylike compliance.But cannot listen—no, I’m only human—While he instructs me how to be a woman.

         <p>Protect women by giving their jobs to men!Call to "Protect women by giving their jobs to men!" was included after the factual
            epigraph in the newspaper. This was omitted from the book. Elsewhere in the column,
            employment-related issues are brought up, including a recent ruling that a wife's
            savings from her housekeeping allowance do not belong to her, the Merchant's Association's
            stance on leave without pay for service in the National Guard in contrast with requests
            from teacher-mothers.</p>Lady, dangers lurk in boilers,Risks I could not let you face.Men were meant to be the toilers,Home, you know, is woman’s place.Have no home? Well, is that so?Still, it’s not my fault, you know.Charming lady, work no more;Fair you are and sweet as honey;Work might make your fingers sore,And, besides, I need the money.Prithee,rest,—or starve or rob—Only let me have your job!

         <p>The fact that Vice-President Marshall has said:My wife is against suffrage, and that settles me,has naturally inspired a good deal of poetry.</p>IFeargus O'Brien writes:My wife dislikes the income tax,And so I cannot pay it;Shethinkssaysthat golf all interest lacks,So now I never play it;She is opposed to tolls repeal(Though why,I cannot say),But woman’s duty is to feel,And man’s is to obey.IIAnd Peter Parkins says:I’m in a hard position for a perfect gentleman,I want to please the ladies, but I don’t see how I can,My present wife’s a suffragist, and counts on my support,But my mother is an anti, of a rather biting sort;One grandmother is on the fence, the other much opposed,And my sister livesdin Oregon, and thinks the question’s closed;Each one is counting on my vote to represent her view.Now what should you think proper for a gentleman to do?Published without a title in newspaper. Are Women People? column likely reprinted
         this from the Women's Journal (Vol. 45, no. 24, June 13, 1914). When republished book,
         changes to the epigraph eliminate indications of external authorship and attribution
         of parts I and II to "Feargus O'Brien" and "Peter Parkins" respectively.
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>SonnetThree bills known as the Thompson-Bewley cannery bills have been advanced to third
         reading in the Senate and Assembly at Albany. One permits the canners to work their
         employés seven days a week, a second allows them to work women after 9 p.m. and a
         third removes every restriction upon the hours of labor of women and minors.—Zenas L. Potter, former chief cannery investigator for New York State Factory Investigating Commission.Let us not to an unrestricted dayImpediments admit. Work is not workTo our employés, but a merry play;They do not ask the law’s excuse to shirk.Ah, no, the canning season is at hand,When summer scents are on the air distilled,When golden fruits are ripening in the land,And silvery tins are gaping to be filled.Now to the cannery with jocund mienBefore the dawn come women, girls and boys,Whose weekly hours (a hundred and nineteen)Seem all too short for their industrious joys.If this be error and be proved, alasThe Thompson-Bewley bills may fail to pass!"""Sonnet"" was published in a different section of the Tribune than MIller's usual
         column. Below it is another poem on the subject of the Thompson-Bewley Cannery Bill
         by Margaret Chanler Aldritch. On page 3 of this issue is an article about a man dressing
         as a woman to work at a corset factory and a woman dressing like a man to work at
         the Warnere Brother's corset factory. Directly below is an article on a woman who
         dressed as a man for four years to earn more money for the support of herself and
         her widowed sister. "
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>To President WilsonI hold it as a fundamental principle and so do you, that every people has the right
         to determine its own form of government. And until recently 50 per cent of the people
         of Mexico have not had a look-in in determining who should be their governors, or
         what their government should be.—Speech ofPresident WilsonWise and just man—for such I think you are—How can you see so burningly and clearInjustices and tyrannies afar,Yet blind your eyes to one that lies so near?How can you plead so earnestly for menWho fight their own fight with a bloody hand;How hold their cause so wildly dear, and thenForget the women of your native land?With your stern ardor and your scholar’s wordYou speak to us of human liberty;Can you believe that women are not stirredBy this same human longing to be free?He who for liberty would strike a blowNeed not take arms, or fly to Mexico."This poem appears in the column without an epigraph. Instead, directly above the
         poem, under the heading, ""Beginning at Home"" Miller modifies the escerpt from Woodrow
         Wilosn's speech that was utilized as the epigraph to his poem, expressing the wish
         that: ""If only President Wilson had said..."".t hat every people has the right to
         determine its own form of government ... and until recently the women of America,
         50 per cent of the people, have not had a 'look in' in determining who should be their
         governors, or what their government should be. Now I am for the 50 per cent. The liberty,
         If they can get it, is theirs. And so far as my influence goes while I am President,
         nobody shall interfere with them."" He did use almost these exact words, but his enthusiasm
         was roused for the liberty of the men of Mexico--not for that of his own country-women.
         Instead, his speech quoted as the epigraph of this poem: I hold it as a fundamental
         principle and so do you, that every people has the right to determine its own form
         of government. And until recently 50 per cent of the people of Mexico have not had
         a look-in in determining who should be their governors, or what their government should
         be."

         <p>An Indiana judge has recently ruled: As to the right of the husband to decide the
            location of the home thathome is where the husband is."Published without a title. Quote above the one in the epigraph not included in book:
            ""The most sacred and potential spot on earth is the fireside shrine, pi and over
            this shrine the devoted mother presides as the reigning sovereieign, the uncrowned
            queen,"" said Mr. Webb, of North Carolina, speaking ti against suffrage."</p>Home is where the husband is,Be it near or be it far,Office, theatre, Pullman car,Poolroom, polls, or corner bar—All good wives remember this—Home is where the husband is.Woman’s place is home, I wis.Leave yourclothes and dishes dryingfamily bacon frying,Leavethe family bacon fryingyour wash and dishes drying,Leave your little children crying;Join your husband, near or far,At the club or corner bar,For the court has taught us this:“Home is where the husband is.”

         <p>A speaker at the National Education Association advised girls not to study algebra.
            Many girls, he said, had lost their souls through this study. The idea has been taken
            up with enthusiasmby many girls, as the following poem indicates:.</p>I will avoid equations,And shun the naughty surd,I must beware the perfect square,Through it young girls have erred:And when men mention Rule of ThreePretend I have not heard.Through Sturm’s delightful theoremsIllicit joys assure,Though permutations and combinationsMy woman’s heart allure,I’ll never study algebra,But keep my spirit pure.

         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>Such NonsenseWhere on earth did the idea come from that the ballot is a boon, a privilege and an
         honor? From men.—Mrs.Prestonia Mann MartinWho is it thinks the vote some use?Man. (Man is often such a goose!)Indeed it makes me laugh to seeHow men have struggled to be free.PoorWashington, who meant so well,AndNathan HaleandWilliam Tell,HampdenandBolivarandPym,AndL’Ouverture—remember him?AndGaribaldiandKossuth,And some who threw away their youth,All bitten by the stupid notionThat liberty was worth emotion.They could not get it through their headsThat if they stayed tucked up in beds,Avoiding politics and strife,They’d lead a pleasant, peaceful life.Let us, dear sisters, never makeSuch a ridiculous mistake;But teach our children o’er and o’erThat liberty is just a chore.Directly above this poem, under the heading "Pleasing to those who like this sort
         of thing" Miller paraphrases the quotations and poem pertaining to Mr Bowdle published
         in the column on January 24th, 1915, "on the subject of women -their feet, their ankles,
         the hooking and unhooking of their dresses, the rallying of wives round the pay check,
         and the fact that all history is nothing but the record of an affair with a women".
         She then quotes the response of the "president of the Connectieut Association Opposed
         to Woman Suffrage," who seemed to have "enjoyed every word of it."
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>A Suggested Campaign SongNo brass bands. No speeches. Instead a still, silent, effective influence.—Anti-suffrage speech.We are waging—can you doubt it?A campaign so calm and stillNo one knows a thing about it,And we hope they never will.No one knowsWhat we oppose,And we hope they never will.We are ladylike and quiet,Here a whisper—there a hint;Never speeches, bands or riot,Nothing suitable for print.No one knowsWhat we oppose,For we never speak for print.Sometimes in profound seclusion,In some far (but homelike) spot,We will make a dark allusion:“We’re opposed to you-know-what.”No one knowsWhat we oppose,For we call it “You-Know-What.”
         <div class="page"><img src="" alt="&#xA;          Page "></div>The Woman of CharmI hate a woman who is not a mystery to herself, as well as to me.—The Phoenix.If you want a receipt for that popular mysteryKnown to the world as a Woman of Charm,Take all the conspicuous ladies of history,Mix them all up without doing them harm.The beauty ofHelen, the warmth ofCleopatra,Salome’s notorious skill in the dance,The dusky allure of the belles of Sumatra,The fashion and finish of ladies from France.The youth ofSusanna, beloved by an elder,The wit of a Chambers’ incomparable minx,The conjugal views of the patientGriselda,The fire ofSappho, the calm of the Sphinx,The eyes ofLa Vallière, the voice ofCordelia,The musical gifts of the saintedCecelia,TrilbyandCarmenandRuthand Ophelia,Madame de Staëland the matronCornelia,Iseult,Hypatiaand naughtyNell Gwynn,Una,TitaniaandElinor Glyn.Take of these elements all that is fusible,Melt ’em all down in a pipkin or crucible,Set ’em to simmer and take off the scum,And a Woman of Charm is the residuum!Miller continues drawing on intertextual and historical references to women elsewhere
         in the column. Under the heading "Whose Business Was It?" she makes reference a quotation
         from the Spectator in May 5, 1710 about the "wife of Hector, in Homer's liad,"(Slightly adapted fromW.S. Gilbert.)

         <p>Because men are men,and women are women. We must not fly in the face of nature.</p>
         <p>Because pockets have been used by men to carry tobacco, pipes, whiskey flasks, chewing

            the dominant note that of woman’s intellectual inferiority.</p>
         <p>1890—Violence is very evident in this season’sfashionsmodes, and our more conservative thinkers are saying that woman suffrage threatens the
            home, the Church and the Republic.</p>
         <p>1900—A complete change of style has taken place. Everything is being worn a l’aristocrate,
            with the repeated assertion that too many people are voting already.</p>
         <p>1915—The best line of goods shown by the leading anti-suffrage houses this spring
            is the statement that woman suffrage is the same thing as free love. The effect is
            extremely piquant and surprising.</p>

         <p>(A by-law of the New York Board of Education says: “No married woman shall be appointed
            to any teaching or supervising position in the New York public schools unless her
            husband is mentally or physically incapacitated to earn a living or has deserted her
            for a period of not less than one year.Satisfactory proof of such incapacity or desertion must be presented to the board
            of education.”)</p>
         <p>CHARACTERS</p>Board of EducationThree Would-Be TeachersChorus by BoardNow please don’t wasteYour time and oursBy pleas all basedOn mental powers.She seems to usThe proper stuffWho has a hus-Band bad enough.All other pleas appear to usExcessively superfluous.1st TeacherMy husband is not really bad—BoardHow very sad, how very sad!1st TeacherHe’s good, but hear my one excuse—BoardOh, what’s the use;,oh, what’s the use?1st TeacherLast winter in a railroad wreckHe lost an arm and broke his neck.He’s doomed, but lingers day by day.BoardHer husband’s doomed! Hurray,!hurray!2nd TeacherMy husband’s kind and healthy, too.—BoardWhy, then, of course, you will not do.2nd TeacherJust hear me out. You’ll find you’re wrong.It’s true his body’s good and strong;But, ah, his wits are all astray.BoardHer husband’s mad!.Hip, hip, hurray!3rd TeacherMy husband’s wise and well—the creature!BoardThen you can never be a teacher.3rd TeacherWait. For I led him such a life,He could not stand me as a wife;Last Michaelmas,he ran away.BoardHer husband hates her, Hip, hurray!Chorus by BoardNow we have foundWithout a doubt,By process soundAnd well thought out,Each candidateIs fit in truthTo educateThe mind of youth.No teacher need apply to usWhose married life’s harmonious.(Curtain.)This discussion continues in heading immediately below the script: ASK YOUR FATHER.
         The New York Board of Education gives as the first cause for which leave of absence
         may be granted: Serious personal illness of the teacher. We have not yet discovered
         whether the illness incident to bearing a child is not serious, or not personal.The Unconscious Suffragists
         <p>“They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives do not enjoy liberty,
            but are absolutely enslaved to those who have votes.”—Benjamin Franklin.</p>
         <p>“No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in law or constitution.”—James Otis.</p>
         <p>“But these great cities, says my honorable friend, are virtually, though not directly
            represented. Are not the wishes of Manchester, he asks, as much consulted as those
            of any other town which sends members to Parliament? Now, sir, I do not understand
            how a power which is salutary when exercised virtually can be noxious when exercised
            directly. If the wishes of Manchester have as much weight with us as they would have
            under a system which gives representatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger
            in giving representatives to Manchester?”—Lord Macaulay’s Speech on the Reform Bill.</p>
         <p>“Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect of universal education:
            for it stimulates all citizens throughout their lives to reflect on problems outside
            the narrow circle of their private interests and occupations: to read about public
            questions; to discuss public characters and to hold themselves ready in some degree
            to give a rational account of their political faith.”—Dr. Charles Eliot.</p>
         <p>“But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their (the American people) desires:
            equality is their idol; they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty and if
            they miss their aim, resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can satisfy
            them without equality, and they would rather perish than lose it.”—De Tocqueville: Democracy in America, 1835.</p>
         <p>“A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe that this benefit is
            best accomplished by popular government because in the long run each class of individuals
            is apt to secure better provision for themselves through their own voice in government
            than through the altruistic interest of others, however intelligent or philanthropic.”—William H. Taftin Special Message.</p>
         <p>“I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose sentiments were noteworthy
            for this: that when they spoke of the people, they were not thinking of themselves,
            they were thinking of somebody whom they were commissioned to take care of. And I
            have seen them shiver when it was suggested that they arrange to have something done
            by the people for themselves.”—The New Freedom, byWoodrow Wilson.</p>
