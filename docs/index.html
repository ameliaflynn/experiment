Dorian Company</p></div><div class="introduction" id="index.xml-front.1_div.2"><h2><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2><p>Alice Duer Miller’s 1915 poetry collection, Are Women People?, can be considered one of the most effective textual interventions of the American women’s suffrage movement. This digital edition re-examines the work in the context of its original publication in Miller's New York Tribune column as well as its modern digital remediations. </p><p> Alice Duer Miller (1874-1942) was a bestselling American poet, novelist, and activist. Born into a socially prominent family on July 28, 1874, in New York City, Miller began publishing poetry and stories to fund her education. Miller pursued higher education at a time when few women did. She attended Barnard College, graduating in 1899 with a degree in mathematics and astronomy. In 1899, she married Henry Wise Miller, and the couple had one son. </p><p>Although Miller gained recognition in the literary world through her poetry and serialized fiction, it was her political engagement during the women’s suffrage movement that brought her widespread acclaim. Miller’s rise in popularity as a writer coincided with the publication of her Are Women People? column, which was published weekly in the New York Tribune between February 1st, 1914 and November 4th 1917, with the exception of an unexplained 13-week absence in fall 1914. In each column, Miller would collect 8-10 news items, quotations, statistics, or satiric verses under catchy headlines. Miller edited a book of her verse and prose from the column for the book Are Women People? (1915), and she followed this with another selection in 1917, Women Are People! The publication of Miller’s column and books were closely tied to its social, political and historical context: first in anticipation of the unsuccessful New York State woman suffrage referendum in November 1915 and then to lobby for the successful 1917 referendum. </p><p>By repackaging her columns into a book, Miller also participated in the broader suffrage movement’s strategy of textual permanence, producing material that could circulate in domestic, educational, and civic spaces beyond the newsstand. The book thus functions as a remediation of feminist activism itself, capturing the immediacy of newspaper polemic while embedding it in the longer-lasting and culturally legitimized medium of print literature. </p><p>This digital edition remediates Are Women People? once more into an TEI-XML-encoded format that makes its two previous remediations more accessible. It seeks to foreground Miller’s text as an artifact of media transition and feminist intervention. Annotations illuminate not only historical and political references but also the ways Miller’s poems reframe dominant media conventions through shifts in attribution and language. An editorial statement on encoding practices soon to follow. </p></div><div class="toc" id="index.xml-front.1_div.3"><h2><span class="head">Contents</span></h2><ul><li class="item">Introduction</li><li class="item">Treacherous Texts</li><li class="item">Campaign Material (For Both Sides)</li><li class="item">Women`s Sphere</li><li class="item">A Masque of Teachers: The Ideal Candidates</li><li class="item">The Unconscious Suffragists</li></ul></div><div class="dedication" id="index.xml-front.1_div.4"><h2><span class="head">Dedication</span></h2><p>To the New York Tribune, in whose generous columns many of these verses first appeared, the author here wishes to express her gratitude.</p></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul class="toc toc_front"><li class="toc"><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-front.1_div.1">ARE WOMEN PEOPLE?

Are not the wishes of Manchester, he asks, as much consulted as those of any other town which sends members to Parliament? Now, sir, I do not understand how a power which is salutary when exercised virtually can be noxious when exercised directly. If the wishes of Manchester have as much weight with us as they would have under a system which gives representatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger in giving representatives to Manchester?”—<span class="persName">Lord Macaulay</span>’s Speech on the Reform Bill.</p><p>“Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect of universal education: for it stimulates all citizens throughout their lives to reflect on problems outside the narrow circle of their private interests and occupations: to read about public questions; to discuss public characters and to hold themselves ready in some degree to give a rational account of their political faith.”—<span class="persName">Dr. Charles Eliot.</span></p><p>“But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their (the American people) desires: equality is their idol; they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty and if they miss their aim, resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can satisfy them without equality, and they would rather perish than lose it.”—<span class="persName">De Tocqueville</span>: Democracy in America, 1835.</p><p>“A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe that this benefit is best accomplished by popular government because in the long run each class of individuals is apt to secure better provision for themselves through their own voice in government than through the altruistic interest of others, however intelligent or philanthropic.”—<span class="persName">William H. Taft</span> in Special Message.</p><p>“I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose sentiments were noteworthy for this: that when they spoke of the people, they were not thinking of themselves, they were thinking of somebody whom they were commissioned to take care of. And I have seen them shiver when it was suggested that they arrange to have something done by the people for themselves.”—The New Freedom, by <span class="persName">Woodrow Wilson</span>.</p></div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Alice Duer Miller.
